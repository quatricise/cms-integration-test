data-cms
== this makes it visible to the cms, this way you cannot accidentally operate on something that you should not
<br>
data-cms-use-children
== which query selector to use on its children and fill them; 
THROWS ERROR when: using use-self alongside this
<br>
data-cms-use-self
== this means the element is filled; 
THROWS ERROR when: using use-children alongside this
<br>
data-cms-src
== some kind of content id match from the integrator that is matched against the content database to fetch the right thing
<br>
data-cms-type
== if the src will be an array of similar structs or a single struct/primitive
<br>
data-cms-overflow
== discard: dont use all src content if there are not enough children; accommodate: duplicate children to make sure all the content from the array is used; 
<br>
data-cms-underflow
== repeat: repeat from the start; hide: do not fill at all; error: throw error to the CMS user to fill it up properly
<br>
data-cms-scripts
== runs some custom logic on this, I'm not sure if that's useful or not but it's an idea.
